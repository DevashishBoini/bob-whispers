      "expected_ai_response": "REST APIs are web services following Representational State Transfer principles. They use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for operations, have stateless communication, use JSON for data exchange, and follow resource-based URLs. RESTful design emphasizes scalability and simplicity.",
      "actual_ai_response": "REST APIs (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interfaces) are an architectural style for designing networked applications. They define a set of constraints for creating web services that are stateless, client-server, cacheable, and layered. These APIs typically use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources identified by URIs, making them a common way for different software systems to communicate over the internet.",
